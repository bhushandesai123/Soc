IDS stands for Intrusion Detection System. It monitors network or system traffic and generates alerts when it detects suspicious or malicious activity, but it does not block the traffic. 

IPS stands for Intrusion Prevention System. It not only detects malicious activity but also actively blocks or prevents the attack in real time since it is deployed inline with the traffic.”

Proxy server 

- Gateway between users and internet.
- helps attackers from entering private network 
- refferal as intermediary server because it goes between user and web pages 
- scans on traffic on port 80,443
-  works on layer 3 and above 
-

Forward Proxy
-  असा server जो internal users चा internet traffic control, monitor आणि filter करतो.
- Internal user ची request आधी proxy कडे जाते
-  Proxy ती request internet वर forward करतो
-  Logs तयार होतात (URL, IP, user activity)
-  Suspicious sites block करता येतात

What is a Protocol?

A protocol is a set of rules that define how data is transmitted and communicated between devices over a network.

HTTP / HTTPS → Used for web communication
TCP → Ensures reliable data delivery
UDP → Faster but no guarantee of delivery
FTP → Used for file transfer
SMTP → Used for sending emails

-  While transferring file via mail There are 2 protocols 1 is SMTP other is ftp
-  to avoid conflict we use port 25 for SMTP and 20 for ftp
-

HTTPS secures communication between the client and server by using SSL/TLS encryption. It encrypts the data before transmission so that even if an attacker intercepts the traffic, they cannot read or modify the information.”

How it works (Simple Explanation):

1️⃣ Client sends request to server (HTTPS)
2️⃣ Server sends its SSL/TLS certificate
3️⃣ Secure session key is generated
4️⃣ Data is encrypted before transmission
5️⃣ Only the intended server can decrypt it

Https ensures cia triad

Difference Between HTTPS and TLS
🔹 TLS (Transport Layer Security)
TLS is a cryptographic protocol.
It provides encryption, integrity, and authentication.
It can secure different protocols (HTTPS, FTPS, SMTPS, etc.).
Works at the transport layer.
👉 TLS = Security technology (encryption mechanism)

HTTPS (HyperText Transfer Protocol Secure)
HTTPS is HTTP + TLS.
It is used specifically for secure web communication.
It runs over port 443.
Used in websites to protect user data.
👉 HTTPS = Application protocol that uses TLS for security

Firewall is for ip

And
Proxy for url

Ip 3 website
virustotal
Ipvoids

Url 3 websites

जसा server हा computer असतो,
तसाच firewall हा network traffic control करणारा security device / software असतो.

Technical Meaning:
Firewall incoming आणि outgoing traffic check करतो आणि rules नुसार allow किंवा block करतो.
उदा:
Port 22 (SSH) फक्त admin IP साठी allow
Port 80/443 public साठी allow
बाकी सर्व block

firewall is a network security device that controls incoming and outgoing traffic based on predefined rules.”

🔥 MUST-KNOW TOPICS FOR SOC INTERVIEW
1️⃣ Networking Basics (Very Important)
You must know clearly:

OSI Model (at least 7 layers basic idea)
Common Ports (Very Important 🔥)

80 – HTTP
443 – HTTPS
22 – SSH
21 – FTP
25 – SMTP
3389 – RDP

3️⃣ Logs & Monitoring (Very Important 🔥🔥)

What are logs?

Windows Event Logs basics

Ransomware

5️⃣ SOC Process Knowledge

What is Incident Response?

What is Alert Triage?

What is False Positive?

Escalation process

Difference Between TCP and UDP
🔹 TCP (Transmission Control Protocol)
Connection-oriented
Reliable (guarantees delivery)
Data comes in correct order
Error checking and retransmission
Slower than UDP

📌 Used in:
HTTP / HTTPS ,FTP ,Email ,SSH

UDP (User Datagram Protocol)
Connectionless
No guarantee of delivery
No ordering of packets
No retransmission
Faster than TCP

📌 Used in:
Video streaming
Online gaming
VoIP
DNS

7 OSI Layers (Top to Bottom)
7️⃣ Application Layer

User interacts here

Protocols: HTTP, FTP, SMTP, DNS
👉 Example: Opening a website

6️⃣ Presentation Layer

Encryption / Decryption

Data formatting
👉 Example: HTTPS encryption

5️⃣ Session Layer

Establishes and manages sessions
👉 Example: Login session
Transport Layer

End-to-end communication

TCP / UDP
👉 Ensures data delivery

3️⃣ Network Layer

IP addressing and routing
👉 Routers work here

2️⃣ Data Link Layer

MAC address

Switch works here

1️⃣ Physical Layer

Cables, signals, hardware
👉 Actual data transmission
